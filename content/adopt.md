    Many dogs end up in the dog shelter through no fault of their own. Separated
    from their loved ones although this love isn't always two-way), in the
    shelter, they are surrounded by unknowns, shut in a cage, confused, scared,
    and sad.  For many of them, the emotional shock is huge.  Although for many,
    puppies are much more attractive, adopting an adult dog has various benefits
    apart from the fact that you could be the last chance to one that could
    spend its last days shut in a cage.


    # Benefits of adopting an adult dog from us


    * The volunteers of the Association know the characters of the dogs and can advise you which would adapt best to your home.  

    * Mature dogs learn quicker.  

    * The adaption to their new life is quicker and often easier. The dog will adapt to the way of its new home, like basic discipline, going to the toilet outside, etc.  

    * You don't have the typical puppies chewing everything or going to the toilet everywhere.
      The size of the dog is how it is, no surprises!!
    * Those that have adopted an adult dog all agree the love that the dog shows towards its new owners is amazing.


    If you would like to adopt one of our dogs, there are a series of steps that you should follow so that the

    dog will be well cared for and to ensure all the efforts of the volunteers and helpers of the Association have not been in vain. The adoption process begins with the completion of a questionnaire (please contact us for more details).


    The person who adopts one of our dogs should always contribute towards the expenses by way of a donation (varies depending on the dog).  This serves to cover a small part of the vet bills such as the internal and external deworming, rabies injection, annual injections, neutering and microchip.  These contributions are essential in order for us to continue our work caring for and looking for homes for abandoned dogs as we don't receive grants from any official institutions.


    For health reasons, puppies are given over in adoption when they are a minimum of 1 month old.  For any further information, please do not hesitate to contact us.


    # Before you adopt...


    The fact that you are thinking of adopting an abandoned dog means that you are a responsible and caring

    person. However, it is a big responsibility.


    If you're like most of us, falling in love with a dog is very easy because sharing your home with a four-legged friend can be one of the greatest pleasures in life. Dogs give us unconditional loyalty and acceptance, constant companionship and even help us to relax after a stressful day at work.


    Having a dog can be very rewarding but only if you've really thought it through before you adopt. Take a

    moment to think about these points:


    **Are you willing to make a lifetime commitment?**


    Adopting a dog simply because it's what people "do" or because the kids have been pining for a puppy usually ends in a big mistake.  Consider that dogs can live 10-18 years.  Don't adopt one on impulse.  First, make sure that everyone in the family is in agreement to having and caring for one.  If it's a puppy, think

    how it will be as an adult because they grow in no time.  It's also important to make sure that no one in the family is allergic or asthmatic, as these illnesses are one of the most common reasons why people decide to get rid of their dogs. Dogs are another member of the family. If you're not willing to make this commitment for life, do not adopt a dog. You will only end up abandoning it and breaking its heart, or worse.


    **Do you have the time to properly care for your new friend?**


    Dogs and other pets can't just be ignored because you're tired or busy. They need food, water, exercise,

    care, and companionship every day of every year. Puppies need more time than adults because depending

    on their upbringing, the result will be an obedient or disobedient dog. If you think your friend will be

    alone for many hours a day, look at the possibility of adopting two so that they will have each other for

    company.  This way also means that they will play more and do less damage due to boredom.  Many dogs that are in shelters are there because their owners didn't realize how long it would take to care for them.


    **Do you have the financial resources to maintain your friend?**


    Food, annual vaccinations, cleaning and hygiene products, toys and veterinary emergencies are some of the costs you need to take into account.  He deserves a good quality of life, adequate food that meets the nutritional requirements plus regular visits to the vet for vaccinations.  Without the proper nutrition and without their vaccinations, the dog could get ill and then you run the risk of even more expenses by taking them to the vet to treat the illness.


    **Are you ready to take care of problems that your 4-legged friend may cause?**


    Fleas, scratched furniture, breakages, hair all over the sofa or in the air, keeps you awake some nights, etc.

    These could be some of the problems that your little friend may cause.


    **Can you have a dog where you live?**


    Many owners' communities don't allow pets and most of them have restrictions. Make sure you know what the rules and regulations are before you bring a dog home.


    **Are you intending to move in the coming years?**


    "We're moving" is the number one reason why thousands of people hand in their dogs to shelters. If you're planning on moving in the future, you need to be willing to find and move to a place where pets are allowed. If you have to face a crisis in your life, such as a divorce or death, would you be willing to keep your dog?


    **Have you considered the available space in your house?**


    The size and type of dog you should adopt depends on the size of your home and above all, the nature and behaviour of the animal.  Take into consideration that big dogs may need large spaces to exercise and develop properly.  Although this is not always the case, a large but quiet dog can adapt perfectly to a 50m2 apartment.


    **Is your lifestyle suitable for the dog you have in mind?**


    The size of the dog is not the only variable to think about. For example, some small dogs are very active and need plenty of exercise to be calm and they often bark at any noise. On the other hand, some big dogs are very quiet and are happy and content to lie on the couch all day. Before adopting, do some research and ask for information. In this way, you will ensure that you choose the dog that will fit in with your lifestyle.


    **Do you know who will care for your dog when you're travelling or on holiday?**


    You will need to have friends or neighbours that you trust or the money to pay for kennels.


    **Could you be a responsible dog owner?**


    Have your dog neutered, obey community rulings and local laws, have the correct paperwork or licenses,

    have your dog microchipped, are all things that are part of being a responsible owner. Of course, giving

    your friend love, companionship, exercise, a healthy diet and regular veterinary care are also essential.


    # Additional tips


    * Don't give dogs as surprise presents.  Your "gift" could be unwelcome and finish up being
      abandoned. Getting a 4-legged friend is a very personal decision.
    * If you let a child choose a dog, guide them and take into consideration one that best suits your
      lifestyle and would be ideal for your home and family.
    * Consider adopting an adult dog. Forget the saying “you can't teach an old dog new tricks”. They
      are generally calmer and more loyal.

    Once you have asked yourself all of these questions, are you prepared to keep and care for a dog for its

    whole life?  When you adopt a dog, that's the promise that you are making.

    Muchos perros terminan en la perrera sin tener culpa alguna. Separado de su
    seres queridos (aunque no siempre el cariño viene por parte del dueño), en
    la perrera todo es desconocido, encerrado en una jaula, confundido,
    aterrorizado y triste, para la mayoría el “shock” emocional es inmenso.


    Aunque para muchos, un cachorro es mucho más atractivo, adoptar un perro adulto tiene varios beneficios, aparte de que posiblemente serás su última oportunidad para evitar pasar sus últimos días encerrado en una jaula.


    # Beneficios de adoptar un perro adulto

    * Los voluntarios de la Asociación conocen los perros y pueden asesorarte

    sobre cuál se adaptará mejor a tu hogar.
    * Los perros adultos aprenden más rápido.

    * Su adaptación a su nueva vida suele ser rápida y fácil. El perro se adaptará a las costumbres de su nuevo hogar aprendiendo comandos básicos, dónde tiene que ir para hacer sus necesidades, etc.

    * Su tamaño es lo que ves ¡¡no habrá sorpresas!!.

    * Las personas que ya han adoptado un perro adulto están de acuerdo en
    que el amor y agradecimiento que el perro muestra a su nueva familia es
    impresionante.
